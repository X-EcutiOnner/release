Offline installers and portable ZIPs.

The offline installer may still need to download some prerequisites if you're on a Windows 7 or 8.1 machine that is not up-to-date via Windows Update. You do not need to have .NET installed, as these builds use self-contained deployment.

The "source code" ZIP does not contain any actual files or source code, it is just included automatically as part of GitHub's "releases" functionality.
